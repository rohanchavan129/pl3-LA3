          <h1>Juicy Marbles gets $4.5M to sizzle up plant-based steaks</h1>
        <p>Convincing meat eaters to adopt a climate-friendly diet might get a little easier thanks to Slovenian startup Juicy Marbles, which has come up with a way to create plant-based whole meat cuts, if that doesn’t sound too oxymoronic.

      ‘Fancy Plant Meat’ is its pithier pitch for a product that aims to provide a vegan alternative to eating a filet mignon steak or other ‘prime’ cuts of (animal) flesh.

      The Ljubljana-based startup is announcing a $4.5 million in seed raise to get its first hunk of prime plant protein to market — starting with the aforementioned (vegan) filet mignon, which is slated for a Q1 2022 launch.

    <h1>Ex-Microsoft exec Harry Shum leads ‘digital economy’ research center in Shenzhen</h1>
    <p>The International Digital Economy Academy (IDEA) quietly opened last year, perched among ultramodern office buildings on Shenzhen’s side of the river border with Hong Kong.

    While geographically separated from Hong Kong, technically, the research institute is located inside a special area straddling the two cities: the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone. The name is self-explanatory. It’s a joint effort by the governments of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, with support from Beijing and favorable policies, to collaborate on scientific and technological research.<a href="third.html">Read more..</a></p>
